# qbr.
A rubik's cube solver written in python 3.

Status: under development.

# Todo List

My future goal is that this becomes a robot that can solve it. It exists already, I know,
but I want to have my own!

##### Goals:

- color detection by camera

- automatically solve the cube using a self-build cube solver.
